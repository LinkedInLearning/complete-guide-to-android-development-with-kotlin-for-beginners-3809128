        Through each generation we’ve adapted and evolved, always keeping our sights set on creating
        the highest quality olive oil, while balancing our time-honored traditions with new
        innovative techniques.\n\n
        We’re passionate, even obsessive, about environmental sustainability,
        and we’re constantly looking to find ways to decrease our footprint on mother earth.\n\n
        We also share a strong sense of community with our customers, fellow farmers, and our beloved Santa
        Rosa neighbors who have embraced our business for many decades. Our high ethical standards
        and well-defined values are central to everything we do.

        backdrop of a 35-acre olive orchard in the beautiful rolling hills of Northern California.\n\n
        Wake up to songbirds flittering about the lush grounds of our 20-room bed and breakfast, and
        feast on mouth-watering breakfasts made from local, organic ingredients.\n\n We’re expert hosts
        who’ve thrown some monumental parties and hosted a wide range of events from anniversaries,
        to charity events, to weddings, and much more.
